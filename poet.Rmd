Idea here is to use cues (key terms provided by us) as inspiration for generative poetry. 

You could also find sentiment based lines from texts to match to your sample https://fronkonstin.com/2017/10/24/a-shiny-app-to-create-sentimental-tweets-based-on-project-gutenberg-books/

```{r}
library(Rpoet)

#Search titles for words. I guess randomising these would be good
get.poetry("title","help|blue|fingers")

```

```{r}
#could probably use markovchain or some other package for NLG from whatever terms are given to it (pick some model)

```
