Heatmaps and stripes have various potentials to show change over time, or variation in some thing. 

A heatmap of average temperature over time for a place (each cell represents a day)

Same thing with walking (see Laurie Frick's great piece 'Walking')

Strip charts

These two have hockeystick::warming_stripes and ...something else https://ropenspain.github.io/climaemet/
Good for both climate data (obviously), and presumably could be modified for other data 
And we can make them kinda pretty with a watercolor kind of effect...(maybe)
```{r}
library(hockeystick)
library(climaemet)
#warming_stripes
hockeystick::warming_stripes()

#underlying function is
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = Year, y = 1, fill = `J-D`)) + 
            geom_tile(show.legend = FALSE) + scale_x_date(expand = c(0, 
            0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = rev(col_strip)) + 
            theme_void()



```
