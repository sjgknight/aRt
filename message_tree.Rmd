* There is an x y axis with one quadrant
* There is a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43773087/how-to-create-stem-plot-in-r 
* Height represents ...duration?
* There is a 'flower' or bush on top of the trunk (representing length?)
* Leaves fall left or right (possibly sent vs received?)

For aesthetics
* the corymb example is really rather beautiful https://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/weeds/data/media/Html/glossary.htm

* EmoGG may be used to insert emoji into charts (as one approach)  install_github("dill/emoGG")
* https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene/houseplants creates houseplants in R...woop
* https://roweyerboat.github.io/drawing_flowers_with_r_and_ggplot2 draws some flower-head-like ggplots
