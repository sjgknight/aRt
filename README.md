# aRt

Using R to create beautiful visualisations.

Focused on exploring personal data, and the potential for the personal to connect us to data visualisation, and of data visualisation to engage us with personal data (and privacy). 

Plus some of them are just beautiful or/and silly.

There are also some generative art packages, some of which I think can be connected to personal data, others probably not (but they're interesting to explore). 

## To work on

I will try and put some dummy data up for the various kinds of visualisation, and to tidy up the different notebooks to give basic demo.  

I am hoping I'll be able to create some of these myself, and that I can get it to a tidy enough point that others (perhaps mdsi students) may improve.
