You can also conect to D3 in R eg using r2d3 (ha) which is maybe cool https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/learning_d3.html 


This one is Aussie bird plumage!! github.com/shandiya/feathers

```{r}



#devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/ggpomological")
#devtools::install_github('Mikata-Project/ggthemr')
library(ggpomological)
library(xkcd)
library(ggthemr)
#hrbrthemes is nice for simple clean themes

#if you want to use xkcd style install the xkcd fonts too (or does the package do this already?)
# library(extrafont)
# font_import(...

#To use ggpomological - which makes pretty looking watercolor styles - create a ggplot as usual, and then + theme_pomological_fancy() to apply the theme
# #There's also a nice paint option to change the background to a textured paper look 
# paint_pomological(pomological_iris, res = 110) %>% 
#   magick::image_write(set_filename("plot-demo-painted.png"))

#ggthemr dust and light themes are also quite lovely, as above, + dust_theme applies

```
